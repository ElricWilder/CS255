Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, wanted help designing a system to enable students to register and set up appointments for in person driving lessons, as well as to take online practice tests and lessons.

What did you do particularly well?

I did well at representing the system design in various diagrams to communicate the system design visually and allow it to be efficiently implemented.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could, I would revise my business requirements document to have more detail. In particular, I would expand on the sections for assumptions, limitations, and non-functional requirements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

My interpretation of user needs was based off of an interview with the CEO and IT Officer of DriverPass. I used the information given in the interview to influence my system design. Considering the user's needs is very important in system design, as the goal of any system should be to meet user's needs. If the system does not do what the user needs and expects it to do, they won't be satisfied with the system. 
    
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software from a perspective of attempting to gather information and as much understanding as possible of what the client wants and how the user's needs will be met. There are various ways to gather information and determine system requirements. For me, reviewing technical documents and interviewing are very effective strategies for determining system requirements and design a system around those requirements.
